The pycoin library uses tox https://testrun.org/tox/latest/ to test rapidly on different versions of python.

Although pycoin has no dependencies, if you want to hack on it, it's recommended that you to install py.test and tox in your development virtualenv.

$ pip install tox pytest

To run just a subset of tests for features under development do something like:

$ cd (project_root_dir)
$ PYTHONPATH=`pwd` py.test tests/scripts_test.py
